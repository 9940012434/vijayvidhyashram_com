								<h6><a href="#">Cultural Events and Celebrations</a></h6>
							<div class="text">By cultural events, a student experiences first hand, the diverse offerings of cultural and artistic expressions found in a community. Watching a play performed is quite a different experience than reading a play from the book. Our students are encouraged to organize and participate in a wide variety of cultural events. We encourage studentsto write a reflective piece about their feeling and experience after attending a cultural event. At VIJAY VIDHYASHRAM, we will shape students, right from childhood to experience various cultures through religious festivals and develop acceptance, understanding, and mutual respect for communities that pave way for harmonious social living. Students develop respect and open-mindedness for other cultures through these celebrations.
